Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Overview

This project uses the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze customer purchase history and group them into distinct segments. By identifying customer clusters based on their buying behavior, businesses can better tailor marketing strategies, personalize offerings, and improve customer retention.

Features
Implements K-means clustering to identify customer groups.
Visualizes customer clusters using various metrics (e.g., purchase frequency, total spending).
Helps in understanding customer behavior for targeted marketing and improved decision-making.
How it Works
The K-means algorithm clusters customers by minimizing the distance between each data point and the centroid of its respective cluster. The number of clusters (K) is determined through iterative analysis, ensuring optimal customer segmentation.
